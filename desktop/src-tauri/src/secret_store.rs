//! OS keyring access for desktop nsec private keys.
//!
//! All secrets are stored as a single JSON blob under one keychain entry
//! (service = the store's service name, username = `"secrets"`). This means
//! exactly one OS prompt per process lifetime regardless of how many keys are
//! stored — the same pattern used by Goose.
//!
//! The chosen backend is selected at compile time by the per-target feature in
//! `Cargo.toml`. On macOS the legacy `keyring` crate (SecKeychain API) is used
//! for the blob entry so that signed release builds and unsigned dev builds
//! share the same store. DPK (Data Protection Keychain) is used only by the
//! one-time migration path that reads old per-key entries written by #1264.
//! Windows and Linux use the `keyring` crate directly. The `system-keyring`
//! feature gates the whole store; when it is off, [`SecretStore`] is unusable
//! and callers fall back to their own `0o600` file storage.
//!
//! The store is deliberately NOT on any env-read path. `BUZZ_PRIVATE_KEY`
//! resolution for harnessed agents and CI is handled upstream (an env
//! short-circuit for the human key, child-process env injection for agents);
//! adding an env tier here would duplicate that precedence and create a
//! divergent-behavior trap.

// ── Interprocess advisory lock ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Two concurrent Buzz processes (e.g. the signed DMG build and an unsigned dev
// build via `just staging`) share the same OS keychain blob because the
// service name `"buzz-desktop"` is a constant — it does not key off the bundle
// identifier. Each process holds its own in-memory cache, so without an
// interprocess lock a warm-cache write in process A drops keys added by process
// B between A's last cache-warming read and A's write.
//
// The fix: `mutate_blob` acquires an exclusive advisory file lock, then always
// performs a fresh `read_blob_raw()` inside the lock, applies the mutation,
// writes back, and releases. The cache is still updated after a successful
// write, so same-process reads remain fast. The lock is file-based at a fixed
// per-user path `/tmp/buzz-keychain-<uid>-<service>.lock` on Unix — a path
// that is invariant to `$TMPDIR`/process environment, so both the GUI-launched
// signed DMG and a terminal-launched dev build always take the same lock.

/// Return the path of the advisory lockfile for `service`.
///
/// The path is `/tmp/buzz-keychain-<uid>-<service>.lock` on Unix — a
/// deterministic per-user path that is invariant to `$TMPDIR`/process
/// environment. Both a GUI-launched signed DMG (`launchd`, env-stripped) and a
/// terminal-launched dev build resolve `/tmp` to the same inode, so they
/// contend on the same lockfile and achieve mutual exclusion.
